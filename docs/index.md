# About Me

![Headshot](assets/Headshot%20Square.JPG){width="300"}

Hello, welcome to my portfolio! 

My name is **Brandon Wang**, and I’m currently a senior at **Duke University** studying **Mechanical Engineering** with a focus on **Robotics & Automation**. I love designing, prototyping, and bringing ideas to life—especially when it comes to robotics. This passion has led me to pursue a **Master of Science** in Mechanical Engineering at Duke, which I plan to complete in one year by Spring 2026.

I am actively involved in **robotics research**, where I contribute to projects that push the boundaries of robotic functionality and adaptability. My work has included designing custom mechanical interfaces, optimizing robotic kinematics, and integrating software-hardware systems.

As I explore career opportunities, I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to bridge the gap between **design and implementation**—whether in robotics, automation, or advanced manufacturing. While I have a strong foundation in hardware, I remain flexible and eager to expand my skills in software, control systems, and machine learning applications in robotics.

When I'm not tinkering with robots, I enjoy playing volleyball on the quad, finding new spots in the Research Triangle to eat, and most importantly, spending quality time with friends! 

Feel free to connect with me if you’re interested in discussing robotics, automation, or potential collaborations!
