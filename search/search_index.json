I love designing, prototyping, and bringing ideas to life\u2014especially when it comes to robotics. This passion has led me to pursue a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Duke, which I plan to complete in one year by Spring 2026.</p> <p>I am actively involved in robotics research, where I contribute to projects that push the boundaries of robotic functionality and adaptability. My work has included designing custom mechanical interfaces, optimizing robotic kinematics, and integrating software-hardware systems.</p> <p>As I explore career opportunities, I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to bridge the gap between design and implementation\u2014whether in robotics, automation, or advanced manufacturing. While I have a strong foundation in hardware, I remain flexible and eager to expand my skills in software, control systems, and machine learning applications in robotics.</p> <p>When I'm not tinkering with robots, I enjoy playing volleyball on the quad, finding new spots in the Research Triangle to eat, and most importantly, spending quality time with friends! </p> <p>Feel free to connect with me if you\u2019re interested in discussing robotics, automation, or potential collaborations!</p>"},{"location":"projects/","title":"Projects","text":"Koda: The Walking BearCam 'n SLAM: Mobile ManipulatorAmphibious CrawlerArchery II <p>Koda is a robotic quadruped that I independently designed and built from scratch with the goal of creating a fully functional, organic-looking walking robot. The design is inspired by Jansen linkages, which drive the robot\u2019s locomotion without the need for complex joint actuation.</p> <p>Click here to watch my journey video!</p> <p>The primary challenge in this project was considering real-world manufacturing constraints beyond just the structural design, such as accounting for air ventilation for the microcontroller, part tolerances, and cable routing holes. If I were to redo this project again, I would reduce the size of the entire assembly and design a component stack that optimizes space within the robot. </p> <p>This project pushed my ability to translate digital designs into physical, working systems, reinforcing the importance of tolerance considerations, real-world manufacturability, and iterative problem-solving.</p> <p></p> <p>Cam 'n SLAM involved simulating a mobile manipulator composed of a MiR 250 mobile base and UR5e robotic arm equipped with an Intel Realsense D435 Depth Camera. The goal was to develop a functional simulation environment using ROS2 and Gazebo, allowing for realistic physics-based interations where the robot could navigate autonomously and perform manipulation tasks within its surroundings.</p> <p>The primary focus was on integrating motion planning and obstacle avoidance to enable the manipulator to execute tasks efficiently while moving through its surroundings. I worked on configuring URDF models for compatiblity with the envrionment, path planning using A* Algorithm, and arm kinematics for manipulation tasks. Additionally, I implemented sensor-based navigation with OpenCV, allowing the robot to respond dynamically to its environment.</p> <p>For more information on this project, visit my dedicated project site here!</p> <p>The Amphibious Crawler is a remotely operated robotic system designed to navigate both land and water while identifying and retrieving visually identical objects based on their ferrous or non-ferrous properties. Using SolidWorks, I designed the mechanical structure, ensuring durability and adaptability for amphibious movement. I implemented Arduino-based motor control, manually waterproofing motor drivers to maintain functionality in aquatic environments. The system\u2019s movement and retrieval mechanisms were controlled via external joysticks, allowing precise operation. Additionally, I collaborated with my team to integrate inductive sensors and a retrieval apparatus, enabling automated material differentiation and object collection.</p> <p>The Archery II project focused on designing an adaptive archery device for Bridge II Sports, enabling disabled individuals with the use of only one arm to independently mount and shoot a bow and arrow. Using SolidWorks, I contributed to the mechanical design, incorporating laser-cut and welded components for durability and precision. I honed rapid prototyping skills to iterate and refine the design efficiently while coordinating task delegation among team members to optimize development. The project culminated in an oral presentation where we presented our design process, testing data, and final prototype to department professors and peers.</p>"},{"location":"resume/","title":"Resume","text":"<p>View my Resume</p> <p>View my CV</p>"}]}
